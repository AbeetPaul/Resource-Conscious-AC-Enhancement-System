# Resource Conscious AC Enhancement System
• Created an IoT-based device to remotely control non-smart ACs, automating temperature and humidity using LM35 and DHT22 sensors. • Integrated a water recycling system to reuse AC drainage for room humidification. • Enabled occupancy-based control using LD-2410 to switch off ACs when no one is present.
